# Actual Craft Times Remade - Misc Addons
Fork of [Actual Craft Times Remade](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/actual-craft-times-remade) by Pawz, itself a Fork of [Actual Craft Time](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Actual_Craft_Time) by osldgoth. The recent Mod [Actual Craft Time Fixed](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Actual_Craft_Time_Fixed) by crackalackin seems to go a different route (of only showing one entity).

## Goal
- Add Button to remove single Entries from the Calculator, instead of having to remove all by toggling the UI.
- Plan on further improvements.

## License
As neither of the forked Projects have explicit Licenses on their GitHub Pages the [Default for Factorio Mods](https://wiki.factorio.com/Modding#Licensing) (MIT-License) seems to apply. Therefore, this Project shall be under the MIT-License as well.
